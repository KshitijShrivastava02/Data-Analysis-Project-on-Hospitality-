# Data-Analysis-Project-on-Hospitality-
Here, I completed a data analysis project on the hospitality domain company. Thank you, Dhaval Patel sir, and Hemanand Vadivel sir, for providing the huge data set. It is very good to practise and to gain hands-on experience on handling such huge data and draw useful insights for the hotel chain management team to gain market share in the competitive environment and helps to strategize, which helps to outperform the industry.

Here I also include KPIs which helps to analyse better.

Process/learning includes 
-> Importing and verifying data set along with few transformations and data cleaning in power Query.
-> Data modeling.
-> Creating Industry useful measures using DAX.
-> Validating all data.
-> Creating Dashboard along with KPIs using Power BI.

few major insights and suggestions are as follows:-

-> They opted inefficient pricing strategy ; here Occupancy is fluctuating week on week but rates are not fluctuating at all , they should opt Dynamic pricing strategy for weekends.
-> Few properties also have low avaerage rating , this also imapacted imensly in todays compitative environment,so they should also work to improve their services and take customer feedback which consequently increases their occupancy and improves ratings
